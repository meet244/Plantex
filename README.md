## Problem Statement 🎯
> Smart City and Defense Hackathon Project

The focus of smart cities should not only be on infrastructure but also on environmental sustainability. Our project aims to address this by providing a solution for **plant disease detection and promoting organic waste management**.

## Solution Overview 💡
We developed a convolutional **machine learning model** using TensorFlow and Keras to detect plant diseases. The model achieved an accuracy of **99%** and is capable of predicting diseases in plants.

## Dataset 📊
We used the [Plant Village dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) for training our model. It contains diseased plant leaf images and corresponding labels.

## Solution Details 🛠️
- **Plant Disease Detection**: The model predicts diseases in plants based on input images.
- **Disease Information**: Future plans include providing detailed information about the predicted disease.
- **Product Recommendations**: We recommend products to cure the detected diseases and offer them for sale.
- **Waste Management**: We operate an offline store where users can exchange wet waste for organic manure.
-  **AI Chatbot**: Implemented with prompt engineering on Gemini, the chatbot helps users navigate, search, and ask for information easily.
- **Flutter App**: We made a simple app in Flutter to provide easy access to the website, as the app is more accessible compared to conventional websites.

### Offline Store 🔄
- Users can exchange 1 kg of wet waste for 1 kg of organic manure.
- The manure is made from the wet waste provided by users, ensuring it is 100% organic.
